Migrated the hosting of blog to ReadTheDocs
===========================================

Migrated the hosting of blog to ReadTheDocs.
This blog is created by using thinkerer meaning it's actually by using Sphinx.
So thinkerer blogs can be avaiable on ReadTheDocs.

But If you want to make it, you need some settings.

Anyway, I'll write after for the detail. 
Actually this is a post for testing.
